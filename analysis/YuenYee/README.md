**Project Notes**

For Milestone 1 & 2, notes and python code can be found in their respective jupyter notebooks. Feedback from Milestone 2 were considered and alterations made to address any concerns can be found in the updated Milestone 2 jupyter notebook.

Milestone 3: Addressed concerns regarding the exporatory data analysis (task 4 - EDA)

The general feedback is that I have attempted to conduct data analysis, including cleaning, processing, wrangling, method chaining and exploratory data analysis, to a satisfactory degree. This provided me with a good foundation for exploring my research question, which is to determine whether there is a relationship between high covid recoveries and stimulant supply (kg & kcal) in different countries. The main concern was that my EDA lacked enough charts and reports to support my research question. To address this concern, I have added more data visualizations such as barplots of the top 30 countries with high recoveries as well as a pie chart to illustrate the distribution of food group consumption in those countries.

Milestone 4: Tableau dashboard

Each member created their own dashboard tabs for their respective research questions. We then combined them and placed the file into our presentation directory.
